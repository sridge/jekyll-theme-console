I'm doing my best to make accurate predictions of the future. As a data scientist, I use my statistical and machine learning knowledge to turn data into actionable insights. I have followed my interest in prediction throughout my education, picking up experience along the way in numerical weather prediction and long-term climate prediction. For my bachelor's degree, I studied meteorology at Virginia Tech, and in May 2020, I received my Ph.D. in Earth and Environmental Science from Columbia University. My dissertation focused on future ocean CO<sub>2</sub> absorption. I used complex and simplified models of ocean CO<sub>2</sub> absorption to identify the key processes driving reductions to future ocean CO2 absorption.
