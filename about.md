I make predictions of the future. I am a data scientist, interested in using my statistical and machine learning knowledge to turn data into actionable insights. I have followed my interest in prediction throughout my education, picking up experience along the way in numerical weather prediction and long-term climate prediction. For my bachelors degree, I studied meteorology at Virginia Tech, and in May 2020, I received my Ph.D. in Earth and Environmental Science from Columbia University. My dissertation focused on future ocean absorption of CO2. I used complex and simplified models of ocean carbon CO2 absorption to indentify the key processes driving reductions to the future efficiency of ocean CO2.
