Put simply, I like to make predictions of the future. I am a data scientist, interested in using my statistical and machine learning knowledge to turn data into actionable insights. I have followed my interest in prediction throughout my education, picking up experience along the way in numerical weather prediction and long-term climate prediction. I did my bachelors in meteorology at Virginia Tech, and in May 2020, I received my Ph.D. in Earth and Environmental Science from Columbia University. My dissertation focused on future ocean absorption of CO2. Ocean absorption of CO2 currently works to reduce the impacts of climate change. In the future, ocean absorption of CO2 will unfortunately become less efficient, and make climate change worse. In my dissertation, I used complex and simplified models of ocean carbon CO2 absorption to indentify the key processes driving reductions to the future efficiency of ocean CO2.
