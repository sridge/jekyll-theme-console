I am a data scientist intrested in a wide variety of challenging problems. I have experience using machine learning and statistics to solve prediction problems relating to climate change, traffic, and weather. I'm interested in applying my statistical knowlege and experience with distributed computing and large datasets to challenging problems that directly impact company decision making. 

Along the way to becoming a data scientist, I have picked up experience in building numerical models and detecting the signals of climate change in noisy climate data. For my bachelor's degree, I studied meteorology at Virginia Tech, and in May 2020, I received my Ph.D. in oceanography/earth and environmental sciences from Columbia University. My dissertation focused on future ocean CO<sub>2</sub> absorption. I used complex and simplified models of ocean CO<sub>2</sub> absorption to identify the key processes driving reductions to future ocean CO<sub>2</sub> absorption. Although I'm moving on from studying the atmosphere and ocean, I'm still a big weather nerd at heart.
