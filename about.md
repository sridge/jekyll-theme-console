I'm just doing my best, trying to predict the future. Along the way to becoming a data scientist, I have picked up experience in building numerical models and detecting the signals of climate change in noisy climate data. For my bachelor's degree, I studied meteorology at Virginia Tech, and in May 2020, I received my Ph.D. in oceanography/earth and environmental sciences from Columbia University. My dissertation focused on future ocean CO<sub>2</sub> absorption. I used complex and simplified models of ocean CO<sub>2</sub> absorption to identify the key processes driving reductions to future ocean CO<sub>2</sub> absorption. Although I'm moving on from studying the atmosphere and ocean, I'm still a big weather nerd at heart.
