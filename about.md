# Sean Ridge
Data Scientist | New York, NY
<br />
I am a data scientist interested applying predictive analytics to variety of challenging problems. I enjoy using my experience with distributed computing to tackle the technical challenges of working with large datasets.
<br />
Along the way to becoming a data scientist, I have picked up experience in building numerical models, validating their predictions, and detecting the signals of climate change in climate data. For my bachelor's degree, I studied meteorology at Virginia Tech, and in May 2020, I received my Ph.D. in oceanography/earth and environmental sciences from Columbia University. My dissertation focused on present and future ocean CO<sub>2</sub> absorption. I used complex and simplified models of ocean CO<sub>2</sub> absorption to identify the key processes driving reductions to future ocean CO<sub>2</sub> absorption.
