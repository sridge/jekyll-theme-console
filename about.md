I'm just doing my best, trying to predict the future. As a data scientist, I use statistics and machine learning to turn data into products and actionable insights. Along the way to becoming a data scientist, I have picked up experience in numerical weather prediction and long-term climate prediction. For my bachelor's degree, I studied meteorology at Virginia Tech, and in May 2020, I received my Ph.D. in Earth and Environmental Science from Columbia University. My dissertation focused on future ocean CO<sub>2</sub> absorption. I used complex and simplified models of ocean CO<sub>2</sub> absorption to identify the key processes driving reductions to future ocean CO<sub>2</sub> absorption.
