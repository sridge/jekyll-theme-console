# Neural network enhanced forecast and weather API
Currently available weather forecasts are not very accurate in mountainous areas. I trained a neural network that reduced average absolute error by >4Â°C in mountainous areas. Part of an API I wrote that returns hyperlocal forecasts and forecast uncertainty. [Demo here](github.com/sridge/wx-forecast-api-demo)
